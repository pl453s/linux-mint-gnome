Who needs a description? Everything is in the title!

This distribution embeds 'Dash to Panel', 'Dash to Dock' and other Gnome extensions. On first login, you can  
choose between a 'panel style' (Windows-like), a 'dock style' (macOS-like) or a 'dash style' (Gnome's defaults).  
You can find a tool called 'Customization'. This is a personalization control center for the Gnome desktop.  
It is developed for the distribution, but is theoretically compatible with any distribution using Gnome.

**Overview of the distribution:** [https://github.com/pl453s/linux-mint-gnome/blob/main/github/tour.md](https://github.com/pl453s/linux-mint-gnome/blob/main/github/tour.md)

**You can also migrate from an official Mint edition installation or upgrade your Mint Gnome installation:**  

Mint Gnome development has become too complex to support scripted migration from official Mint editions.  
Now, the DEB files will be released "as is", use them to migrate by yourself or to upgrade your Mint Gnome installation.  
A separate ISO file will be published, once at a time, each time the project has evolved enough and is stable enough.
