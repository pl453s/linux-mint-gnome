Who needs a description? Everything is in the title!

This distribution embeds 'Dash to Panel', 'Dash to Dock' and other Gnome extensions. On first login, you can  
choose between a 'panel style' (Windows-like), a 'dock style' (macOS-like) or a 'dash style' (Gnome's defaults).  
You can find a tool called 'Customization'. This is a personalization control center for the Gnome desktop.  
It is developed for the distribution, but is theoretically compatible with any distribution using Gnome.
